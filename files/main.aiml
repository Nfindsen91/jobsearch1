  <template>
    Here is a quick comparison between Data Analyst and Network Administrator:
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Primary focus</b><br/>
    Data Analyst: uses data to find patterns, answer questions, and support decisions.<br/>
    Network Administrator: keeps networks and systems running reliably and securely.<br/><br/>
    <b>Typical daily work</b><br/>
    Data Analyst: SQL queries, spreadsheets, dashboards, reports, basic statistics.<br/>
    Network Administrator: configuring switches/routers, user access, monitoring, troubleshooting, backups/patching.<br/><br/>
    <b>Tools you might use</b><br/>
    Data Analyst: SQL, Excel, BI dashboards, Python (sometimes).<br/>
    Network Administrator: Active Directory, command line, monitoring tools, network devices, ticketing systems.<br/><br/>
    <b>If you prefer...</b><br/>
    Choose Data Analyst if you like interpreting information and telling the story of what the data means.<br/>
    Choose Network Administrator if you like hands-on troubleshooting and keeping systems stable.
